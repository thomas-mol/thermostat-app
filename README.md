# Thermostat Application

This project will integrate the ONECTA Cloud API to control a thermostat via a self-made website. 

This readme file will be updated to show the progress made.

 To Do: 

 - Test the authentication and connection with the API
   - Make sure the access-token is properly granted and refreshed when needed
   - Store the authentication code and access-token in local storage or a place it can't be easily accessed by the end-user 

- Generate a theme and styling for the web application

- Implent various uses for the API, like accessing and regulating the thermostat at home
